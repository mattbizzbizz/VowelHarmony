# Turkish Vowel Harmony Project

This project took a look at how Turkish vowel harmony would be modeled within a seq-to-seq RNN.  Additionally, there is data for two additional languages (Chukchi and Finnish), but due to time constraints they were not included in the final paper.  The final paper can be found in the repo under the name acl2023.pdf.
